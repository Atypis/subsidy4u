# Scraper Fixes Applied - 2025-09-30

## Problem Summary
The listing scraper was stuck at page 116/245, preventing collection of remaining ~1,000 URLs needed for the full dataset.

## Root Cause
Silent process crash due to:
1. **Progress tracking race condition** - Page marked complete before URL extraction finished
2. **Inadequate error handling** - Unhandled exceptions caused process termination
3. **Poor error logging** - No detailed diagnostics to identify failures

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Progress Tracking Race Condition ✅
**File**: `src/scrape-listings.js`
- **Before**: Progress saved BEFORE extraction validation
- **After**: Progress saved AFTER successful extraction
- **Impact**: Guarantees no data loss if extraction fails

### 2. Added Per-Page Error Recovery ✅
**File**: `src/scrape-listings.js` (lines 114-175)
- Wrapped page extraction in try-catch
- Scraper continues to next page instead of crashing
- Failed pages logged for manual review

### 3. Improved Error Logging ✅
**File**: `src/utils.js` (lines 92-101)
- Now captures: message, stack trace, page number, URL, timestamp
- Handles errors that don't have .message property
- Provides full diagnostic information

### 4. Added Graceful Shutdown Handler ✅
**File**: `src/scrape-listings.js` (lines 12-17)
- Ctrl+C now saves progress before exit
- Prevents data loss during manual interruption
- Safe mid-run shutdown

### 5. Added Progress Monitoring ✅
**File**: `src/scrape-listings.js`
- Real-time checkpoint logging after each page
- Shows total URLs collected
- ETA calculation for remaining pages

### 6. Added URL Deduplication Detection ✅
**File**: `src/scrape-listings.js` (lines 139-145)
- Detects duplicate URLs
- Prevents re-scraping already collected programs
- Shows new vs duplicate counts

### 7. Fixed Resume Logic ✅
**File**: `src/scrape-listings.js` (lines 22-24, 87-100)
- Auto-resumes from `lastListingPage + 1`
- Direct navigation to resume page (no click-through)
- Support for explicit startPage parameter

## Current Status

### Listing Scraper: RUNNING ✅
```
Process ID: 91063
Started: 2025-09-30 14:40
Current Page: ~119/245
Progress: 48.6% complete
ETA: ~17-21 minutes
Log file: scraper.log
```

### Expected Outcomes
- **Pages 117-245**: ~1,280 new URLs
- **Total URLs**: ~2,440 (current 1,160 + 1,280 new)
- **Completion time**: ~20 minutes from start
- **Robust error handling**: Will not stop on single-page failures

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check scraper progress
tail -f scraper.log

# Check current page number
cat progress.json | jq '.lastListingPage'

# Check total URLs collected
cat progress.json | jq '.scrapedUrls | length'

# Check for errors
cat progress.json | jq '.errors'

# Check if scraper is running
ps aux | grep "node src/scrape-listings" | grep -v grep
```

## What to Do Next

### When Listing Scraper Completes:
1. Verify total URL count: `cat progress.json | jq '.scrapedUrls | length'`
   - Expected: ~2,400-2,450 URLs
2. Check for errors: `cat progress.json | jq '.errors | length'`
3. Start detail scraper: `node src/scrape-details.js`
   - Will auto-resume from index 1257
   - Will process remaining ~1,200 URLs

### If Issues Occur:
- Check `scraper.log` for error details
- Progress is saved after each page
- Safe to restart with `node src/scrape-listings.js`
- Will resume from last completed page

## Technical Improvements Summary

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Silent crashes | ✅ Fixed | All errors now logged with context |
| Data loss on failure | ✅ Fixed | Progress only marked after successful extraction |
| No resume capability | ✅ Fixed | Auto-resumes from exact page |
| Poor diagnostics | ✅ Fixed | Detailed error logs with stack traces |
| Manual interruption unsafe | ✅ Fixed | Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C |
| No progress visibility | ✅ Fixed | Real-time checkpoint logging |

## Files Modified
- `src/scrape-listings.js` - Main listing scraper logic
- `src/utils.js` - Progress tracker error logging
- `progress.json` - Will contain updated state (backup: progress.backup.json)

## Backup Files
- `progress.backup.json` - Original state before fixes applied
